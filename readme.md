## Project Requirements

1. The program does basic Arithmeic operations such as <code>add, subtract, multiply, divide</code>.
2. Throws an exception when user divide a number with zero. <code>Error Message: Cannot Divide by 0!</code>.
3. Uses atleat one class, one static method and one class method.
4. All the claculation is stored in [data/history.csv](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/data/history.csv).
5. Passes [pytest](screenshots/pytest.png)
6. Passes [pylint](screenshots/pylint test.png)
7. 100% test coverage [pytestcov](screenshots/pytest cov.png)
8. Test pass with fake data generated with [faker](screenshots/faker.png). command: <code> pytest tests --num_records=100 </code> for full report we can this command: <code> pytest tests --num_records=10 -v -s </code>.
9. <code>main.py</code> is the entry point of this project, offering a command-line interface (CLI) for executing commands and interacting with the application.
10. You can access log files [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/tree/main/logs).
11. **Implemented LBYL and EAFP in My Code**  
    - **Look Before You Leap (LBYL)**  
      - My code checks if files and directories exist before accessing them (e.g., checking `os.path.exists()` before opening a file).
      - **Example:** In [`history/__init__.py`](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/history/__init__.py), before opening `history.csv`, we check if it exists to avoid an error.
    
    - **Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)**  
      - Instead of checking conditions, my code **tries to execute actions and catches exceptions** if they fail *(e.g., `try/except`)*.
      - **Example:** In [`commands/__init__.py`](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/commands/__init__.py), the function `execute_command()` assumes that the command exists and catches `KeyError` if it doesnâ€™t.

12. **Uses multiprocessing to enable commands to run on separate cores.**  
13. **`.env` is used to set environment variables.**  
14. **Passes GitHub Action Workflow to run [Pytests](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/actions).**  
15. **Design pattern is implemented all over the code.**  
16. **Documentation is available [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/readme.md).**

## Core Functionalities

1. **Command-Line Interface (REPL)**
   - [Add](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/add/__init__.py): Add two numbers.
   - [Subtract](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/subtract/__init__.py): Subtract two numbers.
   - [Multiply](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/multiply/__init__.py): Multiply two numbers.
   - [Divide](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/divide/__init__.py): Divide two numbers
   - [History](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/data/history.csv): Calculation  history is stored in <code.history.csv</code> file.
   - [Plugins](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/tree/main/app/plugins): Dynamically loaded plugins.

2. **Plugin System**
   - My code has a flexible plugin system that allows seamless intergration of new commands without modifying whole code.
   - Plugins are stored [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/tree/main/app/plugins).
   - Each of these plugins are automatically detected and registered when we run the program.
   - When the user run the program with command <code>python main.py</code>, The programs asks to enter <code>menu</code> to view avaliable operations. Output screenshot can be viewed [here](/home/jasu/IS601-Mid-Term/screenshots/output.png).

3. **Calculation History Management with Pandas**
   - We use <code>pandas</code> to enable user to load, save, clear, delete history through REPL interface.
   *Command used in history*
   1. <code>history show</code> Loads all the saved calculation history on to terminal.
   2. <code>history clear</code> Clears who saved calculations.
   3. <code>history delete<n></code> Deletes particular line in history.
4. **Professional Logging Practices**
   - Logging is implemented  for operations, data manipluations, errors and information messages.
   - Log messages are also implemented based on severity <code>INFO, WARNINGS, ERROR.</code>
   - Dynamically logs configuration through environment variables for levels and output destinations.
   - Logs can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/logs/app.log).

5. **Advanced Data Handling with Pandas**
   - We use pandas for data reading and writing into a CSV file.
   - The CSV file manages the history.
   - CSV file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/data/history.csv).

6. **Design Patterns for Scalable Architecture**<br>
   ### *Facade Pattern*
     - Simplifies complex data operations using Pandas.
     - `HistoryCommand` class abstracts the process of **reading, saving, and clearing history** in a **single interface**, shielding users from low-level CSV operations.
     - Example in `history/__init__.py` [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/history/__init__.py).
        ```python
        class HistoryCommand(Command):
            def show_history(self):
                """Show the complete command history from CSV."""
                if not os.path.exists(self.csv_file):
                    print("No command history found.")
                    return
                df = pd.read_csv(self.csv_file)
                print(tabulate(df, headers='keys', tablefmt='pretty'))
     - The reason to use facade pattern as it provides (show_history()) to interact with CSV and Pandas operations.
    ### *Command Pattern*
     - Each operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) is encapsulated in its own command class, following the Command Pattern.
     - Example in `app/plugins/add/__init__.py` [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/add/__init__.py).
       ```python
       from app.commands import Command
       class AddCommand(Command):
           def execute(self, a, b):
               return a + b
     - The above code shows on how each arithmetic operation is treated with <code>execute()</code> method.
    ### *Factory Method*
     - Instead of manually creating command objects, we use a Factory Method in <code>CommandHandler</code>
     - Example in `app/commands/__init__.py` [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/commands/__init__.py)
       ```python
       def create_command(self, command_name):
           """Factory Method: Dynamically creates a command instance"""
           command_class = self.commands.get(command_name)
           if command_class:
              return command_class()
           return None  # Return None if command is not found
     - This follows the Singleton Pattern because it ensures only one <code>HistoryCommand</code> instance exists in memory.
     ### *Singleton Method*
     - Here <code>HistoryCommand</code> class uses Singleton to prevent multiple instances from corrupting history data.
     - Example in `app/plugins/history/__init__.py` [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/history/__init__.py).
       ```python
       class HistoryCommand(Command):
          _instance = None  # Singleton instance

          def __new__(cls, command_handler):
              if cls._instance is None:
                 cls._instance = super(HistoryCommand, cls).__new__(cls)
                 cls._instance.init_history(command_handler)
              return cls._instance
     - This follows the Singleton Pattern because it ensures only one <code>HistoryCommand</code> instance exists in memory.
    ### *Strategy Method*
     - Here we separate different mathematical operations into distinct strategy classes, making them easily swappable.
     - Example in `app/plugins` [here](https://github.com/JaswanthKSnjit/IS601-Mid-Term/blob/main/app/plugins/).
      ```python
      class OperationStrategy:
          def execute(self, a, b):
              pass  # To be overridden

      class AddStrategy(OperationStrategy):
          def execute(self, a, b):
              return a + b
     - This follows the Strategy Pattern by allowing different operations <code>AddStrategy, SubtractStrategy, MultiplyStrategy, DivisionStrategy</code> to be interchangeable.
